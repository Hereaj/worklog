# Weekly Development Log: EDSO Workout Calendar Application
**Period: June 23-28, 2025**

## üìã Overall Project Description

This week involved building a comprehensive fitness coaching platform with dual interfaces - one for coaches to create and manage workout programs, and another for clients to access and track their assigned workouts.
