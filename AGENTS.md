# AGENTS Instructions for Codex

These guidelines apply to the entire repository when working in the Codex environment.

- Maintain weekly work logs in the `internship/` directory as `week{number}.md`.
- Use the format:
  - `# Week X (Date Range)`
  - `## Overview`
  - `## Day-by-Day Summary` with bullet points for each day.
- For the coach backend app, keep features documented and synced with the mobile app, especially subscription and attendance systems.
- When updating backend functionality, ensure API endpoint documentation is refreshed accordingly.
- Run `npm test` before committing, even if the project lacks tests.
