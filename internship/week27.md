# Week 27 (December 15–December 21, 2025)

## Overview
- Built out admin and inventory controls, expanded vendor/retailer location flows keyed by license numbers, improved login and account management safeguards, and finalized engagement plans with tutorials, launch prep, and future roadmap research.

## Day-by-Day Summary
- **Mon:** Built admin user management, removed the license information box for admins in `/settings`, made team member invitations visible, modularized `/user` for location features, and added inline accept/reject buttons to admin signup requests.
- **Tue:** Added a supplier filter to inventory (explicitly showing license numbers), enabled column sorting in the inventory table, and delivered the vendor location feature with shared team ownership keyed by license number.
- **Wed:** Shipped the retailer location feature with shared team ownership keyed by license number and added more column sorting in the inventory table.
- **Thu:** Allowed all users except `admin@weedus.app` to remove accounts (including via `/users`), set `/dashboard` as the post-login root when “remember me” is checked, merged `/retailer/inventory` and `/vendor/inventory` into `/inventory` with role-based rendering, improved login error messaging for duplicate license numbers, blocked sub-manager tiers from editing/adding locations, added feedback in the dropdown navigation tab, and updated license number restrictions.
- **Fri:** Implemented tutorials for vendors and retailers and hosted the WeedUS (BETA) launch party with vendors, suppliers, and retailers.
- **Sat:** Researched the POSaBIT API and set a roadmap for notifications, order/inquiry modules, dashboards with n8n agentic flow, and sales history analytics.
- **Sun:** Off.
