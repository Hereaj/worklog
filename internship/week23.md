# Week 23 (November 17–November 23, 2025)

## Overview
- Strengthened vendor delivery document controls, demonstrated account and delivery flows, and built role-based team management with UI/UX fixes and dashboard alignment.

## Day-by-Day Summary
- **Mon:** Prevented vendors from removing requirements documents on the delivery detail page while still allowing updates, and enabled vendor-side sample document uploads on `/vendor/deliveries/[delivery id]`.
- **Tue:** Presented signup/sign-in and delivery flow demos to stakeholders and gathered feedback to translate into feature documentation.
- **Wed–Thu:** Built the teams feature for retailers and vendors, letting owners add team members, send email signups without admin approvals, access an "employee" link in the profile dropdown to reach `/employees`, manage roles and contact info, and enforce permissions for employees, managers, and owners.
- **Fri:** Stress-tested teams pages across retailer and vendor views; hid "invite a teammate" for employees; allowed owners to remove inactive employees; set invitation emails to use the company's name (e.g., Greenleap LLC) as the sender; ensured all team members see store information on the profile page; hid the Licence tab for managers and employees; enabled employees to update passwords and phone numbers in settings; and counted invoice-approved deliveries as "Pending Invoice" in dashboards.
- **Sat:** Synced employee dashboard status with the owner view so company dashboards match.
- **Sun:** Off.
