# Week 11 (August 25 - August 31, 2025)

## Overview
This week established a flexible subscription system for gym client management, aligned attendance tracking with subscription limits, resolved a race condition in attendance counts, and updated backend integrations and documentation.

## Day-by-Day Summary
- **Day 1-2 (Mon Aug 25 - Tue Aug 26):** Set up the subscription system so the admin coach can create membership plans with name, price, user-type category, and total attendance limits across days, weeks, months, years, or specific date ranges.
- **Day 3 (Wed Aug 27):** Synced class attendance dates with subscription time frames so coaches can automatically enforce attendance limits.
- **Day 4 (Thu Aug 28):** Fixed a race condition causing discrepancies between total attendance and the active plan's limit, preventing clients from exceeding their maximum check-ins. Created an AGENTS.md file for the Codex environment to guide development of the coach backend app's features.
- **Day 5 (Fri Aug 29):** Synced the backend server with the attendance system and mobile app to manage clients according to subscription limits.
- **Day 6 (Sat Aug 30):** Updated backend Coach app API endpoint documentation to keep mobile app development aligned with current features.
- **Day 7 (Sun Aug 31):** Off.
